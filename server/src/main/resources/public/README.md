Before starting the server you must place a directory called 'activities' in this directory. 

The 'activities' directory should include the 'activities.json' file and directories called 01, 02, 03 etc. that contain images related to specific activities. In other words, here should be the files from the generated ZIP file from the Activity Bank repository.

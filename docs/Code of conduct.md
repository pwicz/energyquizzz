# Code of Conduct
 
- In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates\ in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it\ appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the\ agreements if necessary.\

## 1. Assignment description:
### In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group in this course.
- In this course, we want to build the app while working as a team and contributing to the common goal and develop our collaboration, problem solving and critical thinking skills.
---
## 2. Target or ambition level:
### What grade are you working for?
- We are working for the highest possible grade, at least 9. 
---
## 3. Products:
### What should you deliver at the end? 
- At the end of this semester we want to have a finished project. This will mean that the server should be able to run without problems and theoretically an infinite amount of people can connect to it. We want this project to be a fast paced quiz with a couple of features such as jokers and emojis. Jokers will have special abilities that will give the player an edge over the rest. Furthermore there will be two game modes, “Multiplayer” and “Singleplayer”. For singleplayer there will also be an additional scoreboard which will contain the high scores of previous games.
- Design wise we will go for a minimalistic design to keep it clean and clear for the user. The main colors will be green and black. We choose green since this represents energy and thus matches the main theme.

## 4. Planning:
### How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submit it to Brightspace on behalf of the project group?
- We make sure that we are on track and that we keep an eye on deadlines by following the agenda and preparing proper notes describing anything we agree upon during our meetings. We didn’t clarify who will have a final say, because we decided we will make decisions based on voting in the group.

## 5. Behavior:
### How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?
- We treat each other with respect. We discuss the disagreements together and try to choose the best solution as a group. If this does not work, then we will involve the teaching assistant to reach consent. If someone is late during a group meeting, we first try to reach them and check what is happening and then we either wait for a small amount of time or start the meeting in an incomplete group.
---
## 6. Communication:
### In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (in the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)
- We mostly use the Discord platform to communicate, this is where we have all of our meetings and share documents and links. The WhatsApp group chat is an easier way to keep each other updated, plan our next meetings and send reminders about deadlines and other important tasks. We also use the Mattermost platform for professional purposes, where we are able to ask questions and get feedback from our TA. 
---
## 7. Commitment:
### How do you determine the quality of each group's work, so that each group delivers the same quality? How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?
- In gitlab we have to create merge requests, before commiting our work to the main branch. This ensures that at least two persons have analyzed the work of their peers and comment if needed. 
- The chairman should prepare the agenda with all discussion points and questions included - there should be no uncertainty after a properly prepared meeting. Moreover, the chairman should take care of keeping team members informed about upcoming deadlines - they should prepare a list with deadlines and keep it updated on Whatsapp and Discord groups.
- The minute taker must ensure that all discussion points raised at the meeting are described in the notes. On top of that, they should write down and specify the issues that need to be worked on before the deadline or the next meeting. Besides preparing an appropriate document, the note taker must make sure to upload it to the Gitlab repository no longer than 24 hours after the meeting.
---
## 8. Meetings:
### How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?
- As a group, we will meet at least one time on Discord and one time in our TA meeting every week. The preparation for the meetings is different every time and it’s decided by the group and sent in the Discord and the What’s App chats as well as the date and time for the next meeting. 
- If someone cannot attend a meeting, they need to inform the group as soon as possible, at least two hours before the start of the meeting and there needs to be a good reason for not attending the meeting
---
## 9. Decision-making:
### How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?
- We listen to each other's ideas and we choose the best decision as a group
---
## 10. Dealing with conflicts:
### How do you handle conflicts within the group?
- We haven’t yet had any conflicts so this is still to be done
- Our team’s greatest strength is the amount of team-workers it has. With that being said it stands to reason that we can handle conflicts by communicating with each other. If there’s a conflict between 2 people the others would try to help as much as they could in solving it so that our workflow isn’t affected and neither is the group atmosphere.  
---
## 11. Guidance:
### What do you expect from the student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?
- In regards to the TA, we expect her to keep us up to date with the project stages and to give us constructive feedback on our work, both individually and as a group, about the content and collaboration, as any advice from the TA is appreciated.
---
## 12. Consequences:
### What do we do if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements? What are the consequences of this behavior?
- We will first try to find out what makes this group member not keep the agreements and try to work towards a good solution together. If the participant’s behavior does not improve, then the consequences will be decided individually in each case with the teaching assistant. 
---
## 13. Successfactors:
### What makes your team a dream team?
- One of our qualities as a team is that we have all of the Belbin team roles, making us a complete team, since all of us bring something different to the project. We have a strong creative part as well as members with powerful developing skils. Moreover, we communicate a lot with each other, making sure everybody knows what they have to do and the deadlines.
---
## 14. Meeting notes:
### When does the note taker upload the meeting notes?
- The note taker of the week will upload the notes on GitLab at most 24 hours after the end of the TA weekly meeting. This means taking the notes during the meeting, rewriting them in the correct format and uploading them on GitLab in maximum a day. 
---
## 15. Deadlines list:
### Who takes care of keeping the team informed about the upcoming deadlines?
- The deadlines of the week will be taken care of by the chairman of the respective week. They will remind the team members what the assignments are and the due date and time for each of them in a well organized text sent to the group on WhatsApp and Discord. The texts will not only include the big deadlines but they will also contain the tasks we have to do until the next meeting.
---
## 16. Not meeting a deadline:
### What do we do when someone can’t meet a deadline?
- That person should inform other team members at least 6 hours before the deadline, so that someone else can take care of their work. Moreover, the person should have a proper reason - we treat the project with high importance.
---
## 17. Merge requests:
### How do we handle merge requests, when should it be reviewed?
- When a person wants to merge something into the dev branch. The person should assign at least two people and let them know that there is a merge request open. The reviewers then have 24 hours to review it. In the case that they can’t review it in time they should let this know upon getting notified. This way the merge request can be assigned to someone else.
---
## 18. Splitting the workload:
### How do we split the workload?
- We use issues to specify small parts of the final product that need to be worked on. Then, everyone commits to a similar amount of work and resolves their issues before the next meeting where we summarize the progress and decide on further work. The workload that cannot be divided into issues is divided between us individually during our group meetings.

# Meeting Notes Week 7

Location: Drebbelweg 5, PC1 Cubicle 3

Date: 22/03/2022

Time: 13:45-14:30

Attendees: Justin Wisker, Alexandra Velicu, Piotr Politowicz, Javier Perez, Ioana Ilincescu, Mike Erkemeij

## DEADLINES:

- Javi and alexandra should do more merge reviews before friday.
- everyone should do 1-2 reasonably sized issues before friday.

## TO IMPROVE:

### commits

- Every commit should be meaningful, like implementing a certain feature. 
So it should also be reasonably in size not one line in which you delete an import for example.

- To prevent needing to delete one line we should check our code twice before pushing especially on the checkstyle.
- commits shouldn't be 300 lines of code but also not 1-2 so keep it balanced.

### pipeline

- Pipelines should always be quickly fixed. This means they should not be red for more than a day.
- Pipelines should also be green for all branches not just main/dev this makes it so others know that they use working code.

## OTHER:

- We don't need to be able to have our game working for every resolution.
- today we should get an email about red flags and we should deal with this properly.
- javi and alexandra should do more merge reviews!!

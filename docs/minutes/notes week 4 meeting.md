## HCI feedback

-We were good but :)))

-Methods: elaborate more on how the experts evaluated our prototype and how their feedback is connected to the heuristics(And mention them!!)

-Show the order of the improvements and explain how we prioritized them. Keep the pictures ;D

-Problems in the resolves part - explain the problems in the resolves part(We did though)

-Try not to use word &quot;complaints&quot; &#39;:)

-Add 2-3 references at the end of the report - e.g. Nielsen (and others references, not older than 10 yrs though)

- Resolve = measurement - frequency/impact of the problem- how many people complained etc.--- use the frequency-impact matrix explained in lectures to measure all problems.

-Talk about why we chose to resolve each problem- use the ratings

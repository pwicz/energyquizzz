## FEADBACK:
---
### GitLab
---
1. divide issues between us, don’t put everybody on every issue (split the weekly)
2. add more label (client or server-side issue, documentation, testing, to start/ started)
3. change color scheme to red orange and yellow (convention)
4. more relevant titles for issues (jokers -> make players have 3 jokers and elaborate more in the description)
5. add more time estimations (weight = priority, due date = when we want it closed and finished time tracking = we estimate and then we track when we work) for organization at least one of them
6. set up milestones every single week, at the beginning of the sprint
7. an issue is about one single thing with checklists inside
8. add little solutions/hints in the description (a little help for later)
9. 1 or 2 people per issue
10. boards for issues 
11. all equally approve of merge requests and comment what’s not working, but also when there’s no bugs and it’s working
12. merge request should have 2 other people approve
13. let the creator merge their own request (maybe add to code of conduct)
14. merge at the end of every single sprint, but never merge something buggy
15. name branches from the issues
16. never merge stuff that doesn’t pass the pipeline
### Code of conduct
---
1. description of the course too generic, be more specific about the project
2. the goal project wise, not only the grade
3. ioana input: I think we just have to make it longer and much more specific and concrete, using exact times and places and so on (the SMART thing?)
4. write about when it s ok to cancel meeting and things like this (etiquette? Is that the word?)

# Meeting Notes Week 6

Location: Drebbelweg 5, PC1 Cubicle 3
Date: 15/03/2022
Time: 13:45-14:30
Attendees: Justin Wisker, Alexandra Velicu, Piotr Politowicz, Javier Perez, Ioana Ilincescu, Mike Erkemeij

## DEADLINES:

First week with no deadlines!
Stuff on gitlab matters most now! Issues, merge requests, etc.

## TO IMPROVE:

### Issues

Issues must have weights assigned to them. The more complex they are, the bigger weight they have assigned.
Issues should also be distinguishable so that it is clear which ones are to be worked on during the current Sprint. It can be achieved by using milestones or setting proper due times.

### Style and structure of code

All methods (except for getters/setters & test methods) should have a proper Javadoc. A Javadoc plugin can be installed in Intellij to facilitate the creation of such documentation.

### Merging to main

It should be done before Monday (not 20 minutes before the meeting).

### Contribution

Skewed contribution -> Alex & Ioana should work on issues with more weight, Piotr & Mike on issues with less weight.
One merge request per week for everyone - Javi and Alex had too few. Javi and Alex no merge request comments. More reviews!

### Approving merge requests & comments

Merge request comments can point out broken things, if code looks good mention stuff like tests pass, checkstyle good, tests good, features do what they should do, maybe some suggestions... Find some constructive feedback. No approving without comments.

Piotr should approve less.

## OTHER:

UI testing is integration (many files) testing as opposed to unit testing (one thing).

We take good care of pipelines!

Swap client-side and server-side roles.

Make a deadline for musthaves, shoulds, coulds etc.

Timeslots are by group numbers. No idea when they will be assigned. You have to dress nicely.

We can have javadocs for tests, but we don't need to.

Criteria: do other people understand your code. Comments for interfaces are best.
